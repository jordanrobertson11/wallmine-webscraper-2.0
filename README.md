<h1>Web Scraper 2.0 - wallmine.com</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Version 2.0 Functionality Improvements</h3>

- <b>Fixed a bug where some ticker entries would try to scrape data from the tokenised stock. This is done through the use of a custom Google search engine to filter the top result from Wallmine.com</b>
- <b>Added a currency API so that different currencies could be automatically converted to USD</b>
- <b>Included code to automatically standardise the data, all units except for the share price will now display in billions (USD)</b>

<h3>Planned Functionality for Later Versions</h3>

- <b>Host the project on my portfolio website (upcoming)</b>
